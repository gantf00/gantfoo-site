my greatgreatgreatgreat grandpa david 
joined the mormon church in 1835.
he was a quiet, mystic farmer man 
who made money selling dreams, 
interpreting visions, blabbering in tongues.
he owned an apple orchard. 

joseph smith plopped his holy hands 
on my grandpa’s head, imbued him
with elemental melchizedek, 
spirits poured in david’s sunburnt ears,
he wept for three days, he felt god. 

1800s mormon scholar orson p. pratt
theorized on ‘the god particle’ – 
his answer to andromeda’s spin 
and big planets, the newly-known 
depths of space. he said that in the beginning, 
god was in every scattered particle, 
that he organized himself – 
he pulled dust into clusters
and clusters into planets
at His command – 
like holy gravity, like

something pulled David to kirtland – 
where the lord’s new flock built
the new world’s first temple, where
david watched white-robed angels 
circle stained-glass windows, where he
saw fiery corona rush from its steeple
like electrons gush from pulsar jets,

like something pulled him across the plains,
with three wives, nine kids, no job and a knapsack of apple seeds, 
sauntering off to a brave new world,
the first to organize a briny desert swamp;

like four billion years ago, 
earth was space flecks clumping together,
little chunks coalescing, blazing chaos organizing
globby and hot, swelling into gaia, 
how she organized herself – 

neighbors say david was quiet, but perfectly kind. 
he spent the rest of his life wandering utah, 
teaching podunk pioneers to grow fruit
in salt lake city and provo and st. george. 
nobody knows where he’s buried now, but 
his kids said he’s under one of his apple trees.

1.
I wear a pine green apron and
Shout greetings at arriving friends – 
Chill radiating off slunken coats 
They wore to trek to mine for dinner. 

Jacket freeze mingles 
With bubbling kitchen steam, 
Melting clinging-cold to craft 
A cozy, lazy equilibrium.

My friend brought a pretty 
Five-buck cider, I stop 
And hold it in my hands. 
I stir a big pot of curry.

I shout about the flan 
I made, it’s in the fridge, 
we’ll eat it when it’s ready, 
Let it set a while longer;

I uncork wine and sip
And feel its warmth, like fire
Coursing down my hungry throat,
Careening like a comet, 

Like Chicxulub struck the
Earth to kill the dinosaurs – 
The ones whose bones still light
My stove, and I thank them 
            for this home. 

We fill up on rice and curry,
Gulp more wine, our flurried shouting 
Breaths become the window fog,
The flan is ready now, 

I flop it on a tray
Beside a mess of spoons.
Together we commune, 
Ransacking chilly eggy 
            Firmament. 




2. 
Friends gone, front doors locked, 
I start the dishwasher,
Chuck charred broccoli into
Bags, pack bags in fridges — 

Entropy delayed for now,
Counters sterile, spills mopped up, 
Laughs dampened down, crooked seats 
Straightened, colder now – 

The kitchen settles, stasis 
Like a big bang’s final flailings,
Wheezing under everything’s weight,
With nothing left to warm it up – 

No atoms left to birth a sun or 
Filament rods to cook a flan,
When nothing’s hot and bits 
And ions can’t ignite and 
      space can’t make a sound that roars like

Rhythmic rushing water 
Sloshing gunk off cutlery
Inside a kitchen late at night,
Flooding with fluorescent lights 

Like neutron stars that spin out bright, 
That stretched-out time will strip down 
To the bones of bones of bones 
Of carcasses of humming quarks,
The ones that live and buzz in me – 

Rapping on my red cheeks,
Ringing tinny in my sound-soaked ears,
Spinning dizzy in my tipsy chest 
At the end of dinner, elemental symphony 

Echoing in palms of my cold hands, 
Tingling in steaming kitchen water,
Little prickpoint dots, flitting 
              In and out of ether

*The sun was briefly inside of me last night.*

Moroni called for me at midnight - 
Golden trumpet beckoning,
The metal idol’s melody
Spewed zion into jagged night.

God’s heart heaved  in my ears; 
Ripping visions in his bated breath,
Concrete tsunamis lapping asphalt floods, 
Refracting dripping, technicolor cacophony above.

*The sun, inside of me.*

Humming glow inside my veins, my bones –
Your glory choking in my throat and jamming up my fingertips, 
I glow – and you are golden, burned beneath my eyelids,
Scalding holy heresy inside my neck and chest.

*Pouring, pounding, panting, praying.*

All the world illuminated by your sigh –
Radiant beams blasting through 
The swarmy branchy trees, mingling arms,
Caressing spindles beckoning for me.

*You, the sun, the sun, the sun.*

At some point, Moroni left. 
The last flakes of gold shot sadly from his brass cannon,
Melting bitter black to morning honey.
The hunger returned, my stomach churning your guilt. 

His fanfare gone, I wander dazed –
among the broken bottles, glimmering
streaks along relentless craggly curbs,
Parading ragged sneakers on the morning light. 

*Your weight, your light, inside of me.* 

When I shut my eyes, I still see the trees. 
Wooden tendrils, stretching to heavens, 
Praying to God alongside me in 
my own sacred grove, that He found for me that night.

Dear God,
*I hate the way I need your light.*
